This decision space is explored by building a graph whose vertices represent the state of the resource (e.g., processor) after the execution of a set of jobs. The edges of this graph represent possible scheduling decisions that evolve the system states.</p>"},{"location":"#feature-highlights","title":"Feature highlights","text":"<ul> <li>support for both uniprocessor and multiprocessor systems</li> <li>support for dependent and independent jobs</li> <li></li> </ul>"},{"location":"#publications","title":"Publications","text":"<ul> <li>[1] Mitra Nasri and Bj\u00f6rn B.
